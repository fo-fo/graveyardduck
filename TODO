GraveyardDuck handles the 0x80 special control code correctly in decompression, but does not
make use of it when recompressing.

This control byte is only used when the compressor encounters a full 256 bytes in which no RLE
compression is possible. Because this is highly unlikely, I am not very motivated to add
support for this condition.
